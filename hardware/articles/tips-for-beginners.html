				<h1>Tips for Beginners</h1>
<p>Making guitar effects is difficult at the start. A lot of trial and a whole lot of error goes into becoming a decent builder. Here I&#39;m sharing some tips that I had to learn the hard way.</p>
<h3>Start out with something easy</h3>
<p>Your first project should be a kit or designs with detailed instructions, tailored to beginners. It should also have a low component count, especially if you don&#39;t have soldering experience. Good kits can be found at <a href="http://www.generalguitargadgets.com/index.php?page=shop.browse&amp;category_id=7&amp;TreeId=16&amp;phpMyAdmin=4a28f86a515b7883e7bc35a68d4e7b6d&amp;vmcchk=1&amp;option=com_virtuemart&amp;Itemid=45">GGG</a>, <a href="http://www.buildyourownclone.com/">BYOC</a> or <a href="http://www.smallbearelec.com/Projects/ProjandProd.html">Small Bear</a>. As for designs with detailed instructions, the <a href="http://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum/index.php?board=6.0">Beginner Project</a> at the DIYStompboxes forum is great.</p>
<h3>Know what you&#39;re building</h3>
<p>You don&#39;t need to know how to calculate power efficiency and load lines and all that, but have a decent knowledge of how your parts work, both mechanical parts such as switches and jacks, and electrical components. It also helps to be familiar with <a href="http://www.kpsec.freeuk.com/ohmslaw.htm">Ohm&#39;s law</a> and RC filters:<br><a href="http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_2.html">http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_2.html</a><br><a href="http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_3.html">http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_3.html</a></p>
<h3>Keep going</h3>
<p>Your first couple projects might fail. But even if you can&#39;t get them working, you&#39;ve gained experience and you can always go back and fix them later. For debugging, check out <www.geofex.com/fxdebug/newfx.htm></p>
<h3>Join the <a href="http://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum/index.php">DIYStompboxes Forum</a></h3>
<p>This is the best and most helpful effect forum on the internet. Whether or not you post, you&#39;ll learn lots.</p>
<h3>Keep your builds clean</h3>
<p>This is mostly about good planning. Make sure your wires aren&#39;t too long, make sure everything fits well in your enclosure, and make sure all of your solder joints are clean. For examples, check out <a href="http://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum/index.php?topic=36392.0">this thread</a> and, in particular, take a look at the work of posters such as <a href="http://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum/index.php?topic=36392.msg704133#msg704133">John Lyons</a>, <a href="http://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum/index.php?topic=36392.msg631904#msg631904">frequencycentral</a>, and <a href="http://www.diystompboxes.com/smfforum/index.php?topic=36392.msg714619#msg714619">Magnus</a>.</p>
<h3>Don&#39;t skimp on parts</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t try building a circuit into an altoids tin using resistors you cut from an old TV and a transistor that you found left on a sidewalk with all of the markings scratched off. You&#39;d just be making things harder for yourself. Get parts from a guitar effects supplier such as <a href="http://www.smallbearelec.com/StoreFront.bok">Small Bear</a> or <a href="http://www.pedalpartsplus.com/">PPP</a>.</p>
<h3>Use lead solder</h3>
<p>No-one likes to use toxic metals, but lead-free solder is way harder to work with. It doesn&#39;t flow well, it&#39;s harder to heat, you&#39;re more liable to break parts, and it&#39;s very frustrating. If you&#39;re not comfortable with using lead, try using a higher-powered soldering iron.</p>
<h3>Use sockets</h3>
<p>Transistors and ICs are easy to burn out if you aren&#39;t a quick enough solderer, so solder sockets on your board and put the sensitive parts on later. Machined sockets hold pins the best. For transistors, <a href="http://www.smallbearelec.com/Detail.bok?no=101">a strip of sockets</a> that you can break parts off of is the best solution.</p>
<h3>Use a big enclosure</h3>
<p>When you&#39;re starting out, use bigger enclosures than you think you need. Until you get the hang of building cleanly, you&#39;ll need the extra space.</p>
<h3>You don&#39;t have to finish and drill enclosures</h3>
<p>PPP and Small Bear sell painted enclosures. PPP also sells drilled enclosures, either from their template or for a custom one. John Lyons of <basicaudio.net> powdercoats and drills enclosures to custom specs. I&#39;ve ordered enclosures from him and PPP, and I&#39;ve had good results with both.</p>
<h3>Get a breadboard</h3>
<p>Having a breadboard is extremely useful for testing, modding, and designing effects. I always breadboard circuits before building them, to see if they work and to see if there&#39;s anything I want to change.</p>
<h3>Get LTSpice</h3>
<p>This isn&#39;t as important as the other tips, but LTSpice is a great tool for designing, modding, or understanding effects.</p>
